Problem Statement: Dark Mode Toggle Assignment
Objective:
Create a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to toggle between light mode and dark mode by clicking a button.
Requirements:
The page should have a button placed at the center of the screen.
By default, the background color should be white (light mode), and the button text should say "Enable Dark Mode".
When the button is clicked:
The background color should change to black (dark mode).
The button text should update to "Enable Light Mode".
When clicked again, the page should revert back to light mode.
Use CSS for styling and JavaScript to handle the toggle functionality.
Bonus Challenge:
Add smooth transition effects while changing the background color.
Store the user's theme preference using localStorage, so the mode remains the same when the page is refreshed.
